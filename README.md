# Hangman - Rihanna Themed

This application is a basic hangman game built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. At the start, in the "Word to Guess" section, the appropriate number of blanks will appear. The user chooses a letter by clicking a key. If the user guesses a correct letter, the letter will appear in the corresponding blank. If the user fails to choose a letter in the word, the incorrect letter will show in the "Wrong Guesses" box and the "Guesses Left" counter will decrease by one. If the user guesses the correct word before 9 incorrect guesses, they win the game. If the user cannot solve the puzzle in 9 guesses, they will lose the game. An alert will pop up at the end of the game to inform the user if they won or lost.
